# Sarcasm Detection from Bengali Text

Sarcasm detection is the process of identifying whether a piece of text is sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is one of the main challenges for sentiment analysis systems. This is because a sarcastic sentence usually carries a negative implicit sentiment, while it is expressed using positive expressions. This contradiction between the surface sentiment and the intended one creates a complex challenge for sentiment analysis systems. Sarcasm detection received attention in other languages, but Bengali still lags behind. There is a broader business and educational interest in developing a Bengali AI tool to identify sarcastic content. In this regard, We, Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE), CUET, is elated to present an NLP competition, as a part of ETE DecaHertz 2022.
